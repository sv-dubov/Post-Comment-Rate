# Simple Posts with Comments and Rating System
- Add post;
- Add comment to post;
- Add post's rating from 1 to 5 stars (one browser is able to rate one post at one time, after reopen the tab/window user is able to rate post again);
- Display comments under the correspondent post;
- All posts counter;
- Positive posts counter (rating 4-5 stars considers positive);
- Negative posts counter (rating 1-2 stars considers negative);
- Page works via AJAX without reloading: after a visitor adds a new post or comment it rerenderes on the page and the counter recalculates (via AJAX).
